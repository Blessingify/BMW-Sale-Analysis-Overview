## Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the companyâ€™s sales data across various product lines, customers, and countries. Using visual dashboards, we explore historical trends, product performance, geographic distribution, and customer segmentation to identify key insights and drive business decisions.

###  Problem Statement
While total sales have grown significantly, there is an imbalance in performance across different product lines and regions. Some product categories, such as Trains and Ships, contribute minimally, and certain regions remain under-penetrated. Additionally, customer sales are highly concentrated in a few key clients, posing a potential risk if those relationships are disrupted.
