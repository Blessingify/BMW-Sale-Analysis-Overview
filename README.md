###  Problem Statement
While total sales have grown significantly, there is an imbalance in performance across different product lines and regions. Some product categories, such as Trains and Ships, contribute minimally, and certain regions remain under-penetrated. Additionally, customer sales are highly concentrated in a few key clients, posing a potential risk if those relationships are disrupted.

### Objectives
 -	To analyze the overall sales performance by region, product line, and customer segment.
 -	To identify the top-performing and underperforming areas in terms of product and geography.
 -	To understand trends over time and their implications for business planning.
 -	To provide actionable recommendations to enhance revenue, optimize inventory, and improve market penetration.

### Insights
- Classic Cars dominate sales performance, followed by Vintage Cars. Trains and Ships contribute the least.
- Q4 consistently experiences sales spikes, especially in 2019. This reflects strong seasonality in purchasing behavior.

### Observation 
- A small number of customers contribute a large portion of total revenue.
- Sales are strong in North America and Western Europe, while emerging markets show room for expansion.

### Key Findings
	•	Sales are up by 39.28% from the previous year.
	•	Classic Cars alone contribute to over 82% of the top 2 product categories.
	•	USA and Canada lead in geographical sales volume.
	•	There is a heavy reliance on a few top customers, which may pose future risk.
	•	Seasonal spikes are evident in Q4 each year.

 ## Recommendations
-	Diversify the Product Focus:
 Strengthen marketing and development efforts for underperforming lines like Trains and Ships.
- 	Expand Regional Presence:
Invest in emerging markets (e.g., Asia-Pacific, South America) to balance regional contributions.
- 	Customer Risk Mitigation:
Reduce dependency on top customers by nurturing mid-tier clients and expanding B2B outreach.
-	Leverage Seasonality:
Align inventory and marketing campaigns to capitalize on peak Q4 sales.
-	Data-Driven Personalization:
Use historical sales data to personalize offers and upsell to loyal customers.

## Conclusion 
The company has achieved impressive sales growth, with strong performance in select products and regions. However, opportunities exist to improve product diversification, reduce customer concentration risk, and explore underdeveloped markets. Strategic actions based on these insights can ensure sustainable growth and increased market competitiveness.
